In the "reallocation.revenue_loss.xls" excel file, there are three sheets that deal with revenue loss;

'revenue loss'
'revenue loss (2)'
'revenue loss opt-out'

These three sheets use data from the catcher vessel (inshore) fleet from 2003-2007.  (Only the vessels which fished each year were counted.)

Reallocation is done according to the 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 rule, where the last 1/3 reflects a vessel's fishing behavior in a given year.

This calculation is done by computing a z-score (relative ranking: 0 = average) for each vessel, converting to a cumulative (percentile: 0.5 = average) p-value, and then weighting the p-value to derive a q-value (q = alpha * p + beta) that is the last 1/3 portion of reallocation.

alpha and beta are set in the top-left corner, and the changes propagate throughout the sheet.  Note that if no reallocation is to be done, alpha should be set to 0 and beta to 1, as in the 'revenue loss opt-out' sheet.

The amount of unused pollock allocation is computed by considering a vessel to have a constant bycatch rate throughout the season.  For example, if a vessel's actual bycatch were twice its number of credits, we assume it would only be able to fish half of its pollock allocation.  The unharvested pollock is then converted into a revenue loss by multiplying by the pollock price per lb, also set in the top-left corner.

The next two sheets represent calculations of relative bycatch rates relative to pollock harvest.  We use pollock harvest % as a stand-in for vessel size.  The graph shows the distribution of relative bycatch rates.  The other sheet is for calculation of the fit.

'variance (2)'
'variance fitting 2'
